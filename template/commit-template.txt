# Commit Template (NCDS Live Services)

## Why
Fast, consistent commit messages that capture: Jira, summary, impact, risk, and testing.
This helps reviewers, SREs, incident responders, and release notes—without duplicating Confluence.

## Template
Jira: <ABC-123>
Summary: <1-line purpose>
Impact: <user/service impact in a short phrase>
Risk: Low | Medium | High
Testing: <unit | integration | manual on <env>>
Notes: <optional>

## Workflow
1) Stage your changes: `git add -p`
2) `git commit` → the template is auto-inserted
3) Fill the fields; commitlint will error if Jira/Summary are missing
4) Push as normal

## Tips
- Keep Summary to one line.
- If Risk is High, add a short rollback note in Notes.
- For multi-commit work, keep each commit minimal, the PR body and Confluence release notes explain the bigger story.
